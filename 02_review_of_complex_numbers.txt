----------------------------------------------------------------------

Complex Numbers I

Complex numbers are written in the form

	z = x + iy

where

	x is the real component
	y is the imaginary component
	i = the square root of -1

Note that I plan to follow the electrical engineering
convention of using j instead of i, so I will write

	z = x + jy


Complex Numbers II

Because (x, y) is an ordered pair, we can represent a
complex number as a vector in the complex plane:

	z = x +jy = re^(jtheta)

where x + jy is the Cartesian form of z and re^(jtheta)
is the polar form. Recall that e is approximate to 
2.71828, which is Euler's number and therefore e^(jtheta)
is a complex exponential.


Complex Numbers III

Given one form, sometimes we need to convert to the other.
polar to Cartesian coordinates

	x = rcostheta (theta is in radians)
	y = rsintheta

Cartesian and polar coordinates

	r = to the square root of x^(2) + y^(2)
	theta = tan^(-1)(y/x)

Warning: be careful when calculating theta that you know
what quadrant you are in.


Euler's Formula

Euler's formula says that

	e^(jtheta) = costheta + jsintheta

Note that cosine is an even function and sine is an odd
function, so

	cos(-theta) = cos(theta)
	sin(-theta) = -sin(theta)

Using this information, we can see that

	e^(-jtheta) = cos(-theta) + jsin(-theta)
		    = costheta - jsintheta
